# Portal Gaming Hub - Console Version

This code implements a number guessing mini-game, which can be run from the command line. The user navigates through menus to select a platform and then a game, after which they must guess a number within a randomly generated interval while receiving clues about the current interval. The game stores information such as the last time it was played and the current interval limits. 

Additionally, the "main_menu" function displays a series of options and has a different color scheme based on ANSI escape characters if it is run on a Windows operating system with color support.

# How does it work:

- The code imports several libraries: json, time, random, datetime, os, and platform.
- It then checks the type of platform and enables color support on the command prompt if the platform is Windows.
- The main_menu function clears the console and prints out some options.
- The platforms_menu function clears the console and prints out a list of available platforms. It then prompts the user to select a platform and returns the available games for that platform.
- The games_menu function clears the console and prints out a list of available games. It then prompts the user to select a game and starts a mini-game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.
- The generate_number function generates a new random number each time it is called, within a certain range determined by the time since the last time the game was played.
- The countdownMiniGame function is called to give a short countdown before displaying the next message.

# For the program to work correctly:
